## 🏆 Project Summary

A complete HR analytics project focusing on operational efficiency, salary alignment, and performance value.
Raw data was cleaned in Excel, transformed with calculated fields, and visualized in a Power BI dashboard that uncovers critical workforce and financial gaps.

## ⭐ Full Project Overview

This project provides an actionable view of HR workforce health by linking employee status, salary spend, and performance outcomes.
The dashboard enables HR decision-makers to identify cost leakage, staffing imbalance, and talent development priorities.

## 🧽 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Excel Only)

The raw dataset contained several data quality issues:

- Merged Department–Region fields

- Missing or incorrectly formatted salary values

- Numeric fields stored as text

- Irregular phone and ID formats

- Inconsistent performance score formats

### ✔ Excel Methods Used

- Text-to-Columns → Split Department & Region

- SUBSTITUTE + VALUE → Clean salary, phone, and ID fields

- IF formulas → Create Performance Grades (1–4)

- Bucketization → Age Groups, Salary Bands, Tenure Groups

- Pivot Tables → Validate totals before importing to Power BI

## 📈 Key Insights
### 1. ⚠ CRITICAL FINANCIAL LEAKAGE

- A large share of the $85M salary spend goes to Pending (35.2%) and Inactive (29.7%) employees.

- This indicates a major operational breakdown and direct salary waste.

### 2. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Investment Concentration

- DevOps and Sales account for the highest salary expenditure and employee count.

- Requires validation to ensure spending aligns with productivity.

- Cloud Tech is significantly understaffed—creating a potential capability gap.

### 3. 💰 Talent Value Proposition

- Employees aged 25–30 show the highest average performance grade, suggesting the best return on salary investment.

- Ages 36–40 earn the highest salaries, requiring periodic performance validation to ensure compensation alignment.

### 4. 🎯 Talent Development Priority

- Poor + Below Average performers (Grades 1 & 2) make up the largest performance group.

- Targeted development programs can significantly raise the average performance score of 2.58.

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations
### 1. PRIORITY: Salary Governance & Leakage Control

- Immediately audit all Inactive and Pending employees.

- Enforce HR-Finance approval workflows to prevent salary spend on non-active staff.

### 2. Talent Development Program

- Implement coaching and performance improvement plans for low performers.

- Introduce KPIs, learning plans, and quarterly evaluations.

### 3. Strategic Staffing & Workforce Planning

- Increase staffing for Cloud Tech to reduce organizational risk.

- Focus recruitment on the 25–30 age group, which delivers the best performance value.

### 4. Departmental Cost Validation

- Validate high salary spend in DevOps and Sales against actual business output.

- Audit smaller departments for disproportionate salary costs.
